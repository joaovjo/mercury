Mercury is a collection of **AI agent skills** that automate your LinkedIn job search end-to-end, plus a local dashboard to run and track it all. It works with any AI coding assistant that supports skill files (opencode, Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, …) paired with a [LinkedIn MCP Server](https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server) and Chrome MCP.

## Quick Start

```bash
# install (or update) — downloads a prebuilt binary and installs the skills
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniel-Boll/mercury/main/bootstrap.sh | bash

mercury setup        # copy skills into your detected agents (opencode, Claude Code, …)
mercury dashboard    # open the hub in your browser
```

Re-run the **same `curl` command any time to update**. See [Installation](#installation) for prebuilt targets, env overrides, and the source-build fallback.

## The Pipeline

```
                         experience-bank  (periodic, occasional)
                                │ read-only achievement pool
                                ▼
profile-optimizer → job-scout → resume-tailor → recruiter-outreach
     fix your         find the      tailor your      reach the
     profile          roles          resume          recruiters
                                │
                                └──→ portal-filler
                                     autofill the
                                     ATS application
```

## Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **profile-optimizer** | Audits your LinkedIn profile against recruiter-search signals and fixes gaps (Open to Work, headline, location, skills, languages, projects, About, experience) |
| **job-scout** | Searches LinkedIn Jobs by company/location/work-type, pulls full details, and presents a prioritized shortlist with fit assessment |
| **experience-bank** | "Grill me" — periodically interviews you about new achievements and stores them as a tagged, reusable pool in `.mercury/experience/` that resume-tailor draws from. Run occasionally, not per application |
| **resume-tailor** | Takes your base resume + experience bank + scouted roles and produces role-tailored versions with gap analysis, ATS keyword alignment, and cover letters |
| **recruiter-outreach** | Finds technical recruiters at target companies, prioritizes by proximity/mutuals, and sends tailored connection requests |
| **portal-filler** | Autofills an external ATS application form (Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby + generic) from your stored answers and tailored resume, then **pauses for you to review and submit** — it never submits for you |

See [`.github/assets/diagram.html`](.github/assets/diagram.html) for a visual of how the skills work together.

## The Dashboard

Mercury ships a local web dashboard — a central hub for your whole job search.
Run one command and it opens in your browser:

```bash
mercury dashboard
```

What it gives you:

- **Overview** — profile score, recruiters contacted/accepted/replied, interviews, jobs
- **Profile** — recruiter-search metrics charted over time (views, search appearances, connections)
- **Search** — instant LinkedIn job/people search (hybrid: raw results via the LinkedIn MCP)
- **Launch** — run any Mercury skill through your agent (**opencode** or **Claude Code**) over [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com), with a live agent activity stream
- **Recruiters** — kanban pipeline (pending → accepted → replied → interviewing → closed)
- **Jobs / Applications / Interviews / Activity** — everything tracked

The dashboard is a single Bun-compiled binary with the UI embedded. It binds to
`127.0.0.1` on a random port with a URL token, and stores everything in a local
SQLite database at `~/.mercury/mercury.db`.

The `mercury` CLI is both the dashboard launcher **and** the write API the skills
call (`mercury recruiter add`, `mercury job save`, …) — one schema, one source of truth.

## The `.mercury/` Directory

Mercury stores all job search artifacts in a `.mercury/` folder in your workspace:

```
.mercury/
├── base/
│   └── resume.typ              # Your canonical base resume
├── experience/
│   ├── {slug}.md               # One tagged achievement per entry (experience-bank)
│   └── index.md                # Rollup for quick scanning
├── tailored/
│   ├── airbnb-4393940374.typ   # Tailored per role (company-jobId)
│   ├── doordash-3969556398.typ
│   └── uber-4380982336.typ
├── cover-letters/
│   ├── airbnb-4393940374.md    # Full cover letter per role
│   └── ...
├── reports/
│   ├── airbnb-4393940374.md    # Gap/match analysis per role
│   └── ...
├── logs/
│   ├── 2026-06-26T14:30:00.md  # Run history, diffs, keyword scores
│   └── ...
└── config.toml                 # Preferences (base resume path, format, targets)
```

Everything is tracked — you get full traceability of every tailoring run, outreach wave, and profile change.

## Requirements

### MCP Servers

1. **[LinkedIn MCP Server](https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server)** — Profile reading, job search, people search, connection requests
2. **Chrome MCP** — For profile edits that LinkedIn doesn't expose via API (browser automation)

> **Windows gotcha (LinkedIn MCP login):** don't run the LinkedIn MCP login/setup
> (`uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login`) from an **Administrator/elevated**
> terminal. It creates `%USERPROFILE%\.linkedin-mcp\{profile,trace-runs}\` with
> admin-only ACLs; your agent then runs the MCP at normal integrity, can't write
> `trace-runs\`, and it crashes on startup (`PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access
> is denied`, shows as **failed** in `/mcp`). Run the login from a **normal**
> terminal. If you already hit it, fix the ACLs (preserves cookies/login — no
> re-login needed) from an elevated PowerShell:
>
> ```powershell
> takeown /F "$env:USERPROFILE\.linkedin-mcp" /R /D Y
> icacls  "$env:USERPROFILE\.linkedin-mcp" /reset /T /C /Q
> ```
>
> _Thanks to [@juanASP](https://github.com/juanASP) for confirming this on Win11._

### Browser Setup

Chrome MCP auto-starts a Chrome session on its first tool call — no manual
`--remote-debugging-port` launch flags required. Just make sure you're logged
into LinkedIn in that session.

> **Tip:** For multi-step edit flows the skills use Chrome MCP's `pipeline`
> tool (navigate → snapshot → click/fill in one call), which is faster and more
> reliable than individual round-trips.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniel-Boll/mercury/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

The one-liner installs (or updates) Mercury and copies the skills:

- detects your OS/arch and **downloads a prebuilt binary** from the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Daniel-Boll/mercury/releases) (SHA256-verified) → `~/.local/bin/mercury` — no build, just `curl`;
- copies the skills into detected agent dirs (`~/.config/opencode/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`);
- **falls back to a source build** with [Bun](https://bun.sh) if no prebuilt binary matches your platform.

Prebuilt targets: `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `windows-x64`.

> **Windows:** run the one-liner from **Git Bash** (or WSL) — it installs
> `mercury.exe`. There's no `windows-arm64` prebuilt (Bun doesn't compile it);
> on Windows-arm64 the installer falls back to a source build with Bun.

> Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH` (the installer prints a hint if not).
> Re-run the same command any time to update — `mercury` also prints a one-line
> notice when a newer release is available.

**Env overrides:** `MERCURY_VERSION` (pin a tag, e.g. `v0.2.0`), `MERCURY_FROM_SOURCE=1`,
`MERCURY_BIN_DIR`, `MERCURY_SKILLS_DIR`, `MERCURY_NO_SKILLS=1`, `MERCURY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### Installing the skills (`mercury setup`)

The bootstrap copies skills for you. To (re)install them into your agents at any
time — e.g. after adding a new agent:

```bash
mercury setup                 # every detected agent (opencode, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …)
mercury setup --agent opencode   # just one
mercury setup --all              # include agents that aren't detected yet
mercury setup --skills-dir <path># an explicit directory
```

For the **Launch** tab you also need an ACP-capable agent on PATH: `opencode`
(native `opencode acp`) or `claude` (Claude Code, via `@zed-industries/claude-code-acp`).

> Contributing or running from a clone? See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the build
> and dev workflow.

## Usage

The agent loads these skills automatically when your request matches their description. Examples:

- _"Audit my LinkedIn profile and help me get more recruiter messages"_ → loads `profile-optimizer`
- _"Find backend engineer roles at DoorDash and Airbnb in São Paulo"_ → loads `job-scout`
- _"Tailor my resume for these 3 roles I scouted"_ → loads `resume-tailor`
- _"Find recruiters at Uber who hire in Brazil and connect with them"_ → loads `recruiter-outreach`
- _"Fill out this Greenhouse application for me"_ (with a job URL) → loads `portal-filler`

## What Mercury Can Do

### Profile Optimizer

- Pull full profile analytics (search appearances, views, impressions)
- Identify specific pitfalls ranked by recruiter-search impact
- Edit via browser automation: Open to Work (recruiter-only), headline, location, top skills, languages, projects, About section, experience descriptions
- Remove internal-mobility cards that signal "not looking"

### Job Scout

- Search by company + location + work type + seniority
- Get full job descriptions with requirements and compensation
- Assess fit (Strong / Good / Stretch) based on your profile
- Flag diversity-scoped roles, staffing aggregators, and external ATS friction

### Experience Bank

- "Grill me" — STAR-style interview that probes for impact, metrics, scope, and tech
- Seeds from your existing bank + base resume + LinkedIn profile, so it only asks about gaps and new material
- Stores tagged entries in `.mercury/experience/` (skills, tech, domain, role-type, metrics)
- Incremental + idempotent — run periodically (quarterly/after shipping), never re-grills what it already has
- Truthful by construction — structures real stories, never invents

### Resume Tailor

- Parse your base resume (Typst/MD/PDF/txt) + experience bank + LinkedIn profile data
- Pulls role-relevant experience-bank entries even when they aren't on the short base resume
- Batch-tailor to N scouted roles in one pass
- Produce ATS-keyword-aligned Typst output per role
- Generate full cover letters per role
- Gap/match analysis showing what's strong, what's a stretch, what's in your bank, what's missing
- All outputs stored in `.mercury/` with full run logs

### Recruiter Outreach

- Look up company URN IDs (required for LinkedIn's people search filter)
- Find technical recruiters/sourcers at target companies in your region
- Prioritize by: same city > 2nd-degree > mutual connections > relevant title
- Send connection requests with short, specific notes (<300 chars)
- Provide follow-up templates for post-acceptance

### Portal Filler

- Detects the ATS from the job URL (`mercury detect-portal`) and loads its known field selectors — Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, or a generic snapshot-driven fallback
- Fills your contact / eligibility / links from a reusable answer store (`mercury answer set`), maps the rest of the form's labels with `mercury match`, and uploads your compiled resume PDF (`mercury export`)
- **Pauses for human review and never clicks Submit** — you verify the open browser and submit yourself (mirrors `recruiter-outreach`'s confirm step)
- **Never auto-fills EEO/demographic fields**, and surfaces anything it couldn't confidently map instead of guessing
- Edit your stored answers and watch application status (`draft → filled → submitted`) in the dashboard's **Answers** and **Applications** tabs

#### Application CLI (used by `portal-filler`)

```
mercury answer set --key phone --value "+1 555 ..." --category contact
mercury answer list
mercury detect-portal --url "https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/123"
mercury match --labels '["Email *","Phone","LinkedIn Profile"]'
mercury export --typ resume.typ --out resume.pdf
mercury application update --id 1 --status filled --portal greenhouse --unfilled '["work_authorization"]'
```

## Known Quirks & Limitations

- **Auto-apply is fill-then-pause, not fully autonomous** — `portal-filler` fills external ATS forms (Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby) but stops before Submit so you review and send. Workday, Taleo, and iCIMS (multi-step, iframe-heavy, account-gated) and opt-in auto-submit are not yet supported; CAPTCHA/SSO are left to the human.
- **LinkedIn rate limits** — don't send >10-15 connection requests per session
- **Top Skills** are managed inside the About editor (`/add-edit/SUMMARY/`), not the Skills detail page
- **Company URN IDs** are required for people search filters — plain names are silently ignored
- **Typeahead fields** (language, skills) require ArrowDown + Enter after typing
- **"Notify network" toggle** — always verify it's OFF before saving experience edits
